# area-volume-calculator
Calculates area and volume of selected shapes

## Textbook Problem
>Write a class that has three overloaded static methods for calculating the areas of the following geometric classes:
> - Circles
> - Rectangles
> - Cylinders
> 
>Because the three methds are to be overloaded, they should have the same name, but different parameter lists. Demonstrate the class in a complete program
